## Uses

To install Hugging Face's datasets library, follow the instructions from [this link](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/installation#audio).

### Example: Load the dataset and filter for Chinese voices of Ganyu with transcriptions

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
import soundfile as sf
import os

# Load the dataset
dataset = load_dataset('simon3000/genshin-voice', split='train', streaming=True)

# Filter the dataset for Chinese voices of Ganyu with transcriptions
chinese_ganyu = dataset.filter(lambda voice: voice['language'] == 'Chinese' and voice['speaker'] == 'Ganyu' and voice['transcription'] != '')

# Create a folder to store the audio and transcription files
ganyu_folder = 'ganyu'
os.makedirs(ganyu_folder, exist_ok=True)

# Process each voice in the filtered dataset
for i, voice in enumerate(chinese_ganyu):
  audio_path = os.path.join(ganyu_folder, f'{i}_audio.wav')  # Path to save the audio file
  transcription_path = os.path.join(ganyu_folder, f'{i}_transcription.txt')  # Path to save the transcription file
  
  # Save the audio file
  sf.write(audio_path, voice['audio']['array'], voice['audio']['sampling_rate'])

  # Save the transcription file
  with open(transcription_path, 'w') as transcription_file:
    transcription_file.write(voice['transcription'])

  print(f'{i} done')  # Print the progress
```

## Dataset Creation

### Source Data

The data was obtained by unpacking the [Genshin Impact](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/) game.

#### Data Collection and Processing

Please refer to [Genshin-Voice](https://github.com/simon300000/genshin-voice) and [w4123/GenshinVoice](https://github.com/w4123/GenshinVoice) for more information on how the data was processed.

#### Who are the source data producers?

The source data producers are the developers of the game, miHoYo.

### Annotations

The dataset contains official annotations from the game, including language, speaker name, and transcription.

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

Annotations are incomplete. Some voice lines are missing speaker names and transcriptions.

Speakers and transcriptions may contain markups and placeholders: `#<color=#37FFFF>„Éë„Ç§„É¢„É≥Ôºö</color>{NICKNAME}„ÄÅ„Åô„Åî„ÅèÊÄñ„ÅÑÊÇ™Â§¢„ÇíË¶ã„Åü„Åì„Å®„Å£„Å¶„ÅÇ„Çã„ÅãÔºü\\n<color=#37FFFF>{NICKNAME}Ôºö...`

### Recommendations

Users should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the dataset.

Speaker names can be partially inferred from the ingame filenames.
